# Credit-Score-Analysis
Credit Score Analysis by using Generalised Linear Models

In this project, we analyse the data of credit score and to understand the customerâ€™s credit worthiness for application of credit approval. We build generalised linear models for the analyse of the data and find the strongest relationship variable for the prediction of credit approval. 
In this scenario the response variable is binary, and we more than one categorical explanatory variable, henceforth we choose the logistic regression model for the analysis of the data. And we use forward selection method to get best model out of all the models present.  On performing forward selection and removing the insignificant terms we got income, insolvencies, and status of owing house as the strongest variables.
In conclusion, we build a generalised model for the prediction of credit approval by the means of logistic regression model.
